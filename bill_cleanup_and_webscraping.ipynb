    "### Bill Cleanup + Other Data Wrangling\n",
    "- This notebook specifically pulls all data that needs to be trimmed and sorted (and deleted if need be)\n",
    "- It takes in 2009-2022 California Legislature Bills from leginfo.ca.gov as csv\n",
    "- It merges all bills into a single csv\n",
    "\n",
    "- As of right now, the term sorting method is limited due to low ram on my computer + I haven't optimized the web scraping portion yet\n",
    "    - In response, the bills are removed based on the title/descriptions taken from leginfo itself\n",
    "\n",
    "- The final result is a large csv of California Legislature Bills from a certain time period only related to Law Enforcement or any other search terms provided\n",
    "    - This might open doors for context analysis for other types of bills!"

For purposes of this limitation, “full cash value” is defined as the assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under “full cash value” or, thereafter, the appraised value of that real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred. The California Constitution specifies various transfers that are not deemed to be a “purchase” or “change in ownership” of a property for these purposes, including the purchase or transfer of a principal residence from parents to their children, or, under certain circumstances, from grandparents to their grandchildren, and the purchase or transfer of the first $1,000,000 of the full cash value of all other real property transferred from parents or grandparents to their\n \t\tchildren or grandchildren. </div><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">This measure would limit the above-decribed $1,000,000 exclusion for purchases or transfers of real property other than a principal residence to purchases or transfers of nonresidential real property. The measure, except as provided, would provide that the transfer of the principal residence of a parent or grandparent is excluded from “purchase” or “change in ownership” under these provisions only if the transferee uses the residence as his or her principal residence within 12 months after the transfer. If the transferee subsequently ceases to use the residence as his or her principal residence, the measure would require that the residence be assessed at its full cash value as of the date of the transfer from the parent or grandparent to the transferee. The measure would provide that these changes apply to a purchase or transfer of real property on or after the effective date of the measure. The measure would also\n \t\tmake various nonsubstantive changes.</div></span></div><span class=\"hidden\"><h2>Digest Key</h2></span><span id=\"vote\">\n       Vote:\n       <span style=\" text-transform: lowercase\">2/3</span>  </span><span id=\"appropriation\">\n       Appropriation:\n       <span style=\" text-transform: lowercase\">NO</span>  </span><span id=\"fiscalcommittee\">\n       Fiscal Committee:\n       <span style=\" text-transform: lowercase\">YES</span>  </span><span id=\"localprogram\">\n       Local Program:\n       <span style=\" text-transform: lowercase\">NO</span>  </span></div><hr/><span class=\"hidden\"><h2>Bill Text</h2></span><span class=\"Resolution\" title=\"source: /caml:MeasureDoc/caml:Resolution\n     \"><span class=\"Resolved\" id=\"id_53D5A68A-5406-4924-95F6-C14DAF19BB45\"><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\">Resolved by the Senate, the Assembly concurring, That the Legislature of the State of California at its 2019–20 Regular Session commencing on the third day of December 2018, two-thirds of the membership of each house concurring, hereby proposes to the people of the State of California, that the Constitution of the State be amended as follows:</div><div id=\"s20.5338402362249484\"><div class=\"ActionLine\" style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0\"><h3 style=\"font-weight:bold; display:inline;\"></h3> That Section 2 of Article XIII A thereof is amended to read:</div><div><div id=\"id_9A96DB2E-ECC7-4BE7-95ED-C6475964C7CE\"><div><p><div style=\"margin:0 0 1em 0;\"><h6 style=\"display:inline;\">SEC. 2.</h6> (a) <font class=\"blue_text\" color=\"blue\"><i>(1) </i></font>The “full cash value” means the county assessor’s valuation of real property as shown on the 1975–76 tax bill under “full cash value” or, thereafter, the appraised value of real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment.
